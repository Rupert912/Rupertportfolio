<!-- ACCORDION 1 - Aboutme -->
    <div class="accordion">
      <button class="accordion-btn">💻 <b>Why I Built My Own Website</b></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p class="Ownwebpage">
          I chose to build this website because I wanted something more than a traditional CV — I wanted a space that truly represents who I am, what I can do, and how I think. This site is not just a portfolio; it is proof of my effort, determination, and willingness to keep learning and improving.
          <br>
          <br>
          I decided to code my website from scratch instead of using a simple website builder because I wanted to challenge myself. While I am still learning and do not claim to know everything yet, I believe growth comes from doing, practicing, and pushing beyond comfort zones. I use tools and learning resources to guide me, but the work, structure, and continuous improvements come from my own dedication and persistence.
          <br>
          <br>
          This website also reflects my mindset. I believe in being honest about my current skill level while working hard every day to become better. I would rather show real progress than pretend to be perfect. For me, learning is a step-by-step journey, and every new skill I gain moves me closer to my long-term goal.
          <br>
          <br>
          My ultimate ambition is to build a career in cybersecurity, a field that demands discipline, focus, and constant learning. I understand that reaching that goal takes time, experience, and consistent effort. This website is part of that journey — it shows not only what I have done, but also my willingness to take initiative and build my own path forward.
          <br>
          <br>
          More than anything, this site exists to show who I am as a person: someone who works hard, thinks independently, and refuses to stop moving forward. It represents my belief that opportunities are not just given — they are created through persistence, self-development, and the courage to keep trying.
