<h2>💻 <b>Why I Built My Own Website</b></h2>
<p class="Ownwebpage">
    I didn’t add my <b>Web Development (Full Stack)</b> skills on my CV for a reason:
  </p>
    <br>
  <p class="Ownwebpage">
    I know these following HTML tags and skills: 
    <code>&lt;h1-h6&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, 
    <code>&lt;img src=""&gt;</code>, <code>href</code> (inside some codes), <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>, 
    <code>class=""</code> (when linking elements), <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, 
    <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <b>CSS</b>, <code>&lt;button class=""&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.
  </p>
    <br>
  <p class="Ownwebpage">
    I’m learning JavaScript, Node.js, PHP, React, and MySQL for myself — to explore more, understand more, and improve my web development journey step by step. 🌟👨‍💻
  </p>
    <br>
  <p class="Ownwebpage">
    I’m still learning — I don’t know how everything works 100% yet — but I’m teaching myself step by step. 
    Yes, I used ChatGPT for some help on my website, but not for everything. If I wanted everything done for me, 
    I could’ve just used a website builder instead. I chose to <b>code my own portfolio</b> from scratch, 
    because I wanted to challenge myself and prove that I have the motivation to learn and grow.
  </p>
    <br>
  <p class="Ownwebpage">
    I have <b>nothing to lose</b> by building this site — it’s my personal project and my portfolio. 
    If anyone wants my CV to reflect these web development skills, I’ll gladly update and re-upload it.
    Right now, I just prefer to be honest about my current skill level. I don’t want companies to think 
    I’m a perfect fit when I’m still learning — but I am <b>working hard every day</b> to get there.
  </p>
    <br>
  <p class="Ownwebpage">
    I often use <b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a></b> to learn new tags 
    and understand how and when to use them. I’m an <b>honest person</b> who believes everything happens for a reason. 
    I’m not afraid to show what I can do, and I’m never ashamed to admit when I can’t do something yet. 
    Too many people take risks pretending they can — I’d rather learn it properly.
  </p>
    <br>
  <p class="Ownwebpage">
    I always try my best and keep improving. Please have a look at my <a href="Workexperience.html">Experience</a> 
    and <a href="contactme.html">CV</a> (where my personal details are also included). 
    You can also check out my <a href="Aboutme.html">About Me</a> page — it’s still a work in progress, 
    but it shares more of my story and why I approach things differently.

  🎮 The Weirdest Thing I Ever Tried to Make Money
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the strangest yet most creative things I’ve done to try and earn some income involved Minecraft. I asked myself: “Can I make money while enjoying a game I love?” So, I set out to build maps — four in total. The first three were flops or corrupted, but the fourth… that one was special. I poured hours into creating a massive, fully detailed map designed for multiple players. I even built a 500-block railway trophy route, double-layered with 8 rails to choose from, plus mini trophy areas so no one would hit a dead end. I added chests, minecarts, and failsafes to make sure everything could run smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  I loved this map so much that I even made new accounts just to earn trophies again and again. I helped a friend achieve 133 trophies from scratch in just one day, even managing the tricky “100 passing days” trophy by leaving it running overnight. The reactions were priceless — even people I helped were shocked by the map’s design and my dedication.
  <br>
  <br>
  I tried to see if people would support me on Fiverr and a few other platforms. I started at $5, then $10, and even posted YouTube videos showcasing my maps (here’s one:) <a href="https://youtu.be/LSH85w9uMKk"> Minecraft trophy map updated with new texture pack - part 2 </a> — but the response? Almost nothing. Still, I did it because I loved the process, loved helping others, and wanted to see if my creativity could make a difference. I even used Canva for my profile picture and intro videos. 🛠️✨
  <br>
  <br>
  It was weird, fun, exhausting, and incredibly rewarding — proof that thinking outside the box can be just as valuable as any “normal” work experience.

📸 Gallery Update – Thank You for Your Patience 🙏

I want to apologise for the current delay with my gallery section. I’m working hard to get all my pictures uploaded properly — including my setups, nestings, and all the parts I’ve cut. This is my first time coding a website this big on my own, and I want everything to look clean, professional, and high-quality.

Right now, the gallery code isn’t working the way I want it to, and I refuse to upload something that looks messy or unprofessional. I believe in quality over quantity, and I want the gallery to stand out the same way I take pride in my work.

I’m fixing the issues step by step, learning as I go, and I’ll have everything up and running as soon as possible. Thank you for understanding — and thank you for checking out my website. 💪🔥
