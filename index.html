    <div class="accordion">
      <button class="accordion-btn">💻 <b>Why I Built My Own Website</b></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p class="Ownwebpage">
          I didn’t add my <b>Web Development (Full Stack)</b> skills on my CV for a reason:
          <br>
          <br>
          I know these following HTML tags and skills: 
          <code>&lt;h1-h6&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, 
          <code>&lt;img src=""&gt;</code>, <code>href</code> (inside some codes), <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>, 
          <code>class=""</code> (when linking elements), <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, 
          <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <b>CSS</b>, <code>&lt;button class=""&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.
          <br>
          <br>
          I’m learning JavaScript, Node.js, PHP, React, and MySQL for myself — to explore more, understand more, and improve my web development journey step by step. 🌟👨‍💻
          <br>
          <br>
          I’m still learning — I don’t know how everything works 100% yet — but I’m teaching myself step by step. 
          Yes, I used ChatGPT for some help on my website, but not for everything. If I wanted everything done for me, 
          I could’ve just used a website builder instead. I chose to <b>code my own portfolio</b> from scratch, 
          because I wanted to challenge myself and prove that I have the motivation to learn and grow.
          <br>
          <br>
          I have <b>nothing to lose</b> by building this site — it’s my personal project and my portfolio. 
          If anyone wants my CV to reflect these web development skills, I’ll gladly update and re-upload it.
          Right now, I just prefer to be honest about my current skill level. I don’t want companies to think 
          I’m a perfect fit when I’m still learning — but I am <b>working hard every day</b> to get there.
          <br>
          <br>
          I often use <b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a></b> to learn new tags 
          and understand how and when to use them. I’m an <b>honest person</b> who believes everything happens for a reason. 
          I’m not afraid to show what I can do, and I’m never ashamed to admit when I can’t do something yet. 
          Too many people take risks pretending they can — I’d rather learn it properly.
          <br>
          <br>
          I always try my best and keep improving. Please have a look at my <a href="Workexperience.html">Experience</a> 
          and <a href="contactme.html">CV</a> (where my personal details are also included). 
          You can also check out my <a href="Aboutme.html">About Me</a> page — it’s still a work in progress, 
          but it shares more of my story and why I approach things differently.

  <p class="about-intro">
  💼 I'm currently based in Johannesburg and working toward relocating to the <b>Western Cape around mid-2026</b>, once I've saved and secured stable employment. My responsibilities come first — I won't relocate without proper planning.
  <br><br>
  I'm also exploring <b>international IT opportunities</b>, including cruise ship roles, as part of my long-term career growth. For now, my focus is gaining experience, earning certifications (N+, S+), and building skills that open doors wherever the right opportunity appears. 🚀
