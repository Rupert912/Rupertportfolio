📸 Gallery Update – Thank You for Your Patience 🙏

I want to apologise for the current delay with my gallery section. I’m working hard to get all my pictures uploaded properly — including my setups, nestings, and all the parts I’ve cut. This is my first time coding a website this big on my own, and I want everything to look clean, professional, and high-quality.

Right now, the gallery code isn’t working the way I want it to, and I refuse to upload something that looks messy or unprofessional. I believe in quality over quantity, and I want the gallery to stand out the same way I take pride in my work.

I’m fixing the issues step by step, learning as I go, and I’ll have everything up and running as soon as possible. Thank you for understanding — and thank you for checking out my website. 💪🔥
