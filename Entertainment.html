            <a href="https://www.nrl.com" target="_blank"> NRL Website </a> – My favorite sport of all time!
            <br>
                Since late 2019 (around November) — and even going back to July 2018 — I was searching for new sports to watch. In 2019, I discovered the National Rugby League (NRL) for the very first time in my life. Before that, I had never even heard of rugby league. The sport immediately caught my attention, and I quickly fell in love with it.
                <br>
                <br>
                At the time, I didn’t have a team to support because everything was still new to me. There were 16 teams in the competition back then, before the Dolphins joined as the 17th team in 2023. I decided to watch a full season first before choosing my favorite club.
                <br>
                <br>
                When the season began, three teams stood out to me: the Penrith Panthers because their logo and style caught my eye, the New Zealand Warriors because of my long-time love for New Zealand as a country, and the Melbourne Storm because Melbourne always seemed like an amazing place to me.
                <br>
                <br>
                After just three rounds, I made my decision — the Panthers became my main team, while the Warriors became my second team and my favorite New Zealand side.
                <br>
                <br>
                When COVID-19 disrupted the season, I was disappointed the sport had to stop, but later the Storm went on to win the Grand Final against the Panthers. From 2021 to 2024, however, the Panthers achieved an incredible four-peat, something no other club has managed in the modern professional era. With the Perth Bears set to join the NRL in 2028 as the 18th team, I’m excited to see how the competition continues to grow. I truly love the challenge, passion, and excitement that this sport brings.

          In July 2018, I was searching for new sports to watch, and this was when I came across Formula One. Although I had known about F1 for many years, I had never really followed it until late 2018 and early 2019, before COVID-19 impacted the world. I began taking a much stronger interest in the sport around 2020.
          <br>
          <br>
          I have always loved Scuderia Ferrari, but at times their performance and challenges have been disappointing. Because of this, I also enjoy supporting Red Bull Racing. What I enjoy most about F1, however, is seeing new contenders step up — whether it’s causing unexpected upsets, achieving a podium finish, or even winning a race.
          <br>
          <br>
          Formula One is exciting to watch because of its intensity, strategy, and the incredible skill required from drivers who must perform at their absolute best on race day to fight for wins or valuable championship points.

        <br>
          In July 2018, while I was searching for new sports to watch, I also explored Motocross World Championship. I had actually known about this sport for a long time because I used to play off-road rally and bike games, which already gave me an appreciation for it.
          <br>
          <br>
          I don’t have a specific team or favorite rider, but I truly enjoy watching the sport. The skill level of the riders and teams is incredible — racing close to each other, performing jumps and technical maneuvers, and constantly fighting for the best possible position. It takes intense training, focus, and courage, which is what makes this sport so exciting.
          <br>
          <br>
          Motocross is also one of the more dangerous sports, as things can go wrong very quickly during a race. Despite the risks, the riders continue to compete with determination and passion, which makes it even more impressive to watch.
          <br>
          <br>
          Even though I don’t follow it every weekend like I do with the NRL, whenever I come across it, I always stop to watch for a while. It’s a sport I have loved since discovering it, and it’s something I simply can’t let go.

          <br>
          This is where things really started to change for me. In July 2018, while searching for a new sport to watch, I first came across the World Rally Championship (WRC) after I had stopped following rugby union (which I will mention later). At first, it seemed exciting, but over time it started to feel repetitive to me. The races often felt similar, the cars didn’t always have the high speed I enjoy, and there wasn’t as much drifting as I expected.
          <br>
          <br>
          Because of this, I continued exploring and eventually discovered the World Rallycross Championship — and that completely changed my experience. I instantly loved the energy, the atmosphere, and the action. Even though the tracks are shorter, the joker laps add strategy and excitement. The drifting, the close racing, and the incredible skill and passion from the drivers make it thrilling to watch.
          <br>
          <br>
          When I saw the Volkswagen rallycross cars competing, I naturally chose them as my favorite team. While I don’t watch the sport every single time it’s on, I truly love it. It’s not an addictive sport for me like the NRL, but whenever it catches my attention, I can watch it for hours.
          <br>
          <br>
          For me, this feels like the kind of rally action I really enjoy — exciting, skillful, and full of energy. It’s a sport that always manages to lift my mood when I’m feeling down or just need something fun and engaging to watch.

          <br>
          This is one sport that almost everyone in the world knows from a young age — Association football, also known as soccer. When I was a kid, I only watched it occasionally. I liked Manchester United back then, but I didn’t truly support them because I didn’t really understand the game or know the players yet.
          <br>
          <br>
          What really caught my attention came during the 2019/20 UEFA season in a match between Liverpool FC and Atlético Madrid at Anfield. Liverpool needed a win after losing the first match 0–1. I found out about the game because one of my brothers, who loves soccer, was hoping Liverpool would lose. That’s when I noticed Atlético Madrid — I loved their jerseys and decided from that day to support them as my club. In the end, Liverpool lost 2–3, with Atlético Madrid winning 4–2 on aggregate.
          <br>
          <br>
          After that, I also started following the Premier League more closely and chose to properly support Manchester United. They have gone through some difficult seasons and struggles, but I’ve never believed in changing teams just because of tough times — in sports, every club has ups and downs, and improvement always comes with time.
          <br>
          <br>
          I don’t watch soccer as regularly as I watch the NRL or Formula 1, but I usually follow it when there are no races or matches from those sports. Sometimes I also watch it between seasons. This is how I gradually grew to love soccer as well. While some matches can be slow or less exciting, there are also games that are absolutely unforgettable — regardless of who wins or loses.

          <li>🏆 GTA V Online - <a href="https://www.socialclub.rockstargames.com/games/gtav/ps5/career/overview/gtaonline" target="_blank"> Rupert SocialRockstar Online overview</a>
          <br>
          I am a dedicated Grand Theft Auto Online player with over 3,500 hours played. Throughout my online journey, I have earned more than $1 billion in total in-game money, reached rank 750+, and currently hold over $250 million in spending money.
          <br>
          <br>
          I also own all three of the newest mansions released in the December 2025 DLC, fully upgraded. Everything I have achieved in GTA Online was earned legitimately — I do not use glitches or cheats. I strongly believe that hard work pays off, no matter how long it takes.</li>
          <li>🤠 Favorite Story Game — Red Dead Redemption 2 - My all-time favorite story game is Red Dead Redemption 2. I absolutely love the campaign so much that I keep replaying it whenever I’m in the mood.
          <br>
          <br>
          With 700+ hours played, I still find myself wanting to return to its world. The game’s storytelling, atmosphere, emotional moments, and beautifully designed missions make it unforgettable.</li>
          <li>⛏️ Minecraft - Minecraft may seem simple at first, but once you get into it, it becomes incredibly addictive. I have built five trophy worlds over time, with some earlier ones unfortunately becoming corrupted.
          <br>
          <br>
          My current world is close to 2,000 in-game days, and it’s designed so that every trophy can be completed quickly and easily. Beyond trophies, I also love building in Creative Mode — including a full city once, complete with an Olympic stadium, multiple sports arenas, and even a shopping mall.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is a game that becomes truly amazing once you have a purpose and imagination to build.</li>
          <li>🎯 Other Favorite Games</li>
          <li>Car & Racing Games — always fun and relaxing</li>
          <li>Shooter Games like Tom Clancy's The Division and Sniper Elite, which I find incredibly satisfying</li>
          <li>Sports Games, especially Supercross titles</li>
          <li>The Grand Theft Auto series from GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas — classic games I still enjoy today</li>
          <li>Cities: Skylines, where building and managing a city is very relaxing</li>
          <li>The Uncharted series — especially parts 1 to 3, which I replayed many times</li>
          <li>The Last of Us Parts I & II — among the best survival story games I’ve ever experienced</li>

          Outside the house, I enjoy being active and social. I love having a braai (our version of a BBQ), spending time cooking meat, relaxing, and socializing with others. I also like running to stay fit, and sometimes I participate in Warrior Race events, where you run 5km, 10km, or 15km with obstacles. While I don’t have a gym contract, I still enjoy basic workouts like push-ups, sit-ups, and general fitness training. Before COVID-19, I used to attend events such as sports matches and music shows and really enjoyed going with friends. These days, I don’t go to events anymore because I work part-time on weekends, so I’m usually not available to attend them. Another activity I enjoy is driving — even though I’m not always in the mood for long trips, I still like the experience and atmosphere, even when traffic gets hectic. I also really enjoy washing cars, both inside and outside, making them clean and fresh again. To me, a clean car feels just like a clean house — fresh, satisfying, and rewarding.

          At home, I enjoy simple things that make me feel comfortable and relaxed.

I also enjoy cleaning my room because a clean space feels fresh and peaceful afterward. Watching TV is another thing I like, whether it’s movies, series, or YouTube. I watch a wide variety of content, from cars and music to history, gaming, and more.

          📚 Studying & Learning
          <br>
          Even though this is part of my entertainment page, learning is actually something I genuinely enjoy today. In the past, I did not always feel this way, but over time I realized that not everything you learn has to be purely “important” to be valuable. Some topics are simply interesting, and sometimes curiosity pushes you to keep researching until you fully understand how something works or what it is about. That process of discovering new knowledge can be very satisfying.
          <br>
          <br>
          I especially enjoy researching topics related to the IT field, including advanced technologies, unusual concepts, or things I have never encountered before. At the same time, I understand the importance of building strong fundamentals first, because practical entry-level experience is essential before moving too far into advanced areas. For me, learning is about growing step by step while staying curious.
          <br>
          <br>
          I believe learning is something you can do every day, even in small ways. It may not always feel entertaining, but it can teach valuable lessons and sometimes even help in unexpected situations. Knowledge often becomes useful when you least expect it, whether in problem-solving, decision-making, or pursuing personal interests.
          <br>
          <br>
          For this reason, I would always rather spend time learning than doing nothing. Gaining knowledge keeps the mind active, opens new opportunities, and can even help you become better at the things you already enjoy. In my view, learning is a lifelong process that never truly stops.

          <br>

          ☕ Drinking Habits & Preferences
          <br>
          Over the years, my drinking habits have changed a lot, especially as I became more aware of health and balance. Coffee has always been one of my favorites. Before COVID-19, I used to drink quite a lot — sometimes 8 to 10 cups on cold days and 4 to 6 on warmer days. Today, I keep it more moderate, usually around three cups a day, occasionally four if I’m really in the mood.
          <br>
          <br>
          Tea is something I rarely drank in the past, but that changed after I experienced COVID-19. Since then, it has become part of my daily routine, especially in the mornings, and sometimes I enjoy it again later in the day. I also like hot chocolate during cold weather, though only occasionally — usually one or two cups at most. It’s not something I drink often, and I generally avoid similar drinks like Milo because I simply don’t enjoy the taste.
          <br>
          <br>
          Water became much more important to me after a hospital visit around 2015–2016, which was largely due to drinking too many sugary soft drinks. Since then, I have made a conscious effort to stay hydrated. While I still occasionally enjoy soft drinks, it is usually just one or two glasses, and I balance it with water. Energy drinks are something I once consumed regularly, sometimes daily, but now I only have one very rarely — perhaps every few months — and prefer sports drinks like Energade or Powerade instead.
          <br>
          <br>
          When it comes to alcohol, my habits have also changed significantly. In my younger years, I drank brandy quite often, usually socially with friends. However, in my mid-twenties I decided to cut back drastically. Today, I rarely drink brandy, and a single bottle can last me months. I sometimes enjoy cider or a few gin-based drinks, but I limit myself carefully and stop once I feel uncomfortable, always switching to water. I also don’t drink beer, as I’ve never liked its taste. Overall, I focus on drinking responsibly and maintaining a healthier balance than I did in the past. I also prefer my coffee and tea without sugar, simply because that’s how I enjoy them most.

          Socializing with Friends:
          <br>
          I truly enjoy spending time talking with my friends, sharing common interests, and simply having a good time together. Even though I don’t have a large circle, the friends I do have mean a lot to me. We can talk about serious topics, joke around, and just relax in each other’s company. Socializing helps keep friendships strong, because friends support each other and bring positivity into life. Over the years, I have had good friends, lost some, and also experienced friendships that did not work out. You can usually feel when something is not right. I have also learned that friendships formed outside of work can feel different from those built in a workplace environment, where challenges or misunderstandings sometimes affect relationships. Still, I value the role friends play in keeping life balanced and meaningful.
          <br>
          <br>
          Socializing with New People:
          <br>
          Meeting and socializing with new people requires patience, understanding, and good communication. Whether it is a new friend, colleague, manager, client, or someone you meet casually, it is important to listen carefully and understand their perspective. Some people are easy to connect with and enjoy conversation and humor, while others are more serious and prefer focused discussions. This does not mean they dislike social interaction — it often reflects their priorities, personality, or even the stress they may be experiencing. I respect these differences and believe that with time, you learn how each person prefers to communicate. No matter how easy or difficult someone may seem, treating others with respect is always essential, especially in today’s demanding world.

          It is not because I want to be single — the main reason is that I have felt stuck in a difficult situation for a long time. Over the years, I have met and spoken to some wonderful women, but things often did not work out because of my life circumstances. Building a stable career, securing consistent income, and being able to live independently have been ongoing challenges for me, especially after setbacks like losing my car during the COVID-19 period. Many people my age were already more established, and this made it harder for relationships to move forward.
          <br>
          <br>
          I have been in relationships before, including one around 2017–2018 that ended after I discovered dishonesty. Later, I developed feelings for someone else, but that situation also ended painfully. Experiences like these were difficult, but they helped me understand what I truly want in a relationship — honesty, respect, and clear communication.
          <br>
          <br>
          In recent years, I met someone I genuinely care about, and we have built a strong connection over time. However, distance and financial limitations have made it difficult for us to meet in person and take things further. This has been frustrating at times, because I believe a real relationship should grow beyond online communication and shared interests, even though we connect well and have many things in common.
          <br>
          <br>
          Overall, I do not see being single as a permanent choice, but rather as a phase shaped by circumstances I am still working to improve. My focus remains on building stability in my life so that when the right opportunity comes, I can fully invest in a healthy and meaningful relationship.

          Home Language — Afrikaans:
          <br>
          Afrikaans is my home language, which I have spoken since childhood. Like many countries, we grow up learning our native language first, and this is the language I use most comfortably in everyday life. I speak Afrikaans daily with family, friends, and most people around me. Because of this, it remains the language I understand and express myself in best. When both people share the same home language, there is usually no need to switch to another language.
          <br>
          <br>
          Second Language — English:
          <br>
          English is my second language, which I learned at school. Over the years, I have used it regularly, especially when communicating with people who do not speak Afrikaans. While I can understand and speak English well, I still consider myself a learner and continue trying to improve. Sometimes when I feel nervous, I may struggle to pronounce certain words or form sentences smoothly, but I always do my best to communicate clearly. Since English is widely spoken around the world, I see it as a very important language to keep developing.
          <br>
          <br>
          Third Language Interest — French:
          <br>
          During my high school years, I became interested in learning French and even bought a learning book with CDs to help me get started. I was excited at first, but balancing school responsibilities made it difficult to stay consistent. After leaving school, my focus shifted toward finding work and building my future, and I never returned to continue learning the language. However, it remains something I may consider revisiting one day.
          <br>
          <br>
          Fourth Language Experience — Spanish:
          <br>
          I began learning Spanish around 2017–2018 when my parents planned a possible move to Paraguay, a Spanish-speaking country. This motivated me to take the learning seriously. Using apps, videos, and my own notes, I learned basic conversational skills, including the alphabet, numbers, common vocabulary, and everyday phrases. While I was not fluent, I was able to hold simple conversations. Unfortunately, our plans to relocate changed when COVID-19 disrupted everything, and the move never happened. Even so, the experience of learning Spanish was valuable and remains something I’m proud of.
