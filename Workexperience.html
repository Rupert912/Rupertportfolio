  January 2015 – February 2020
  <br>
  <br>

  I worked in a precision engineering environment operating lathe machines (1m & 2m bed), milling machines and assisting on a slotting machine. My work included the preparation, roughing and machining of shafts, blocks, gears and other custom components in materials such as mild steel, stainless steel, aluminium and various engineering plastics (PTFE, etc).

  I used measurement tools including vernier calipers, tape measures, internal and external micrometers to ensure correct dimensions. I assisted with deburring, cleaning finished parts, sharpening drills, and keeping the workshop organized. I occasionally completed basic administrative tasks using Word and Excel and assisted with stock control. I was also able to read and interpret engineering drawings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reason for leaving: Company closed during COVID-19.

  October 2023 – September 2024
  <br>
  <br>
  I operated a Morn 3000×1500 laser cutting machine producing parts from mild steel, stainless steel, aluminium and galvanized sheet material. I cut up to 20mm mild steel, up to 8mm stainless steel and up to 5–6mm other materials. I used CypCut software and G3 compressor control to load jobs from server, apply lead-ins, microjoints, cooling, engraving zones and check nesting layouts.

  Daily tasks included basic lens cleaning, surface cleaning, verifying correct part counts based on job cards, operating night shift production and assisting with general housekeeping when needed. I sometimes drew simple parts (washers / rectangles) when requested. I also used vernier calipers and tape for dimensional checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reason for leaving: Ended employment after internal hearing process. I appreciate the experience gained during my time there.</p>
