      💪 My journey into IT started with curiosity and grew into a career commitment.
      After earning my CompTIA A+ certification and building hands-on experience through self-directed projects, I'm now expanding into networking (N+) and security (S+).
      <br>
      This portfolio showcases my technical skills, problem-solving approach, and continuous learning mindset. My diverse background — from precision manufacturing to hospitality — has taught me adaptability, attention to detail, and how to perform under pressure.
      <br>
      I'm ready to bring that same work ethic and dedication to an IT support role where I can grow long-term. Let's connect. 🔥

      This About page goes a little deeper than most. It’s not meant to be read all at once, and it doesn’t have to be.

        Let’s say it this way — you can, but it’s not a must-read. I share my story because it shows how everything that’s happened in my life shaped who I am today — my challenges, my goals, and my determination to never give up.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m still looking for a job today, not because I haven’t tried, but because I refuse to just sit back and wait for something to happen. People often say, “Life goes on,” when things get hard — and they’re right. We can’t hold onto the past forever. We have to move forward, learn from what’s behind us, and give our best every single day.
        <br>
        <br>
        No matter how many rejections I face, or how many times I’m overlooked by companies that don’t yet see my full potential — I keep pushing forward. Even when things feel impossible, I work harder than before. 💪
        <br>
        <br>
        Because in life, it doesn’t matter if you’re 21, 45, or even 82 years old — if you want to work, if you want to grow, you’ll do it with pride every day. It’s all about the decision you make: either keep pushing, or sit and wait for nothing to change.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes, a short break is needed — but too long of a break can hold you back. That’s why I keep going. One step at a time, every day, toward the IT career I’ve dreamed of. 🌍💻

    <!-- ACCORDION 2 - LONG STORY -->
    <div class="accordion">
      <button class="accordion-btn"><b>🌟 About Me – My Journey (long story)</b></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p class="Mylongstory">
          I wanted to make a long, outstanding story, so let’s start:
          <br>
          <br>
          I was always the kind of person who knew early in life what I wanted to become. Back in high school, I already realized what I truly wanted to do — but I also knew I was in the wrong school for it.
          <br>
          <br>
          I had the opportunity to work with my dad, who owned his own business, and that’s where my first work experience began. His company specialized in mechanical engineering — working with machines like lathes, milling machines, slotters, drills, and even a bit of CNC. He made gears, sprockets, shafts, keys, and many other custom parts.
          <br>
          <br>
          We worked for several companies, including one fruit juice manufacturer in Apex, Brakpan (I think their name was Tru Fruit), where we built entire conveyor systems from scratch. We designed, built, and installed everything — from the belts that moved the juice bottles, to the labelers, and even the bottle guides. That company loved my dad’s work and always chose him for new projects. We also did a lot of work for Clover in Boksburg. Their contact person trusted my dad completely, and we always had more work than time — often working until midnight or 1 a.m. and being back at 6 a.m., sometimes for months with only one weekend off.
          <br>
          <br>
          From January 2015 to February 2020, I worked full-time with my dad. My parents once considered sending me to college, but they noticed that I wasn’t in the right field of work, so they waited for me to decide my own path. During those years, I saw how others around me were improving, growing, and succeeding, but I wasn’t. I realized that true success comes from doing what you love and what you’re naturally good at — and while I respected the trade, it wasn’t for me.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2019–2020, I traveled to Cape Town during the holidays and even thought about staying there, but I knew finding work in engineering would be difficult, as that field is smaller and the cost of living is higher there. Around February 2020, my dad decided to close his business. He saw the signs of the pandemic coming — he and my mom were in South America at the time, and COVID-19 had already started spreading there. He also wanted to immigrate to South America, so when the business closed, I was left without work for the next three years.
          <br>
          <br>
          During that time, I decided to study. I found an online institute based in Ireland that offered web development courses — unfortunately, it turned out to be a scam and doesn’t exist today. But that’s how I discovered web development. It was my first exposure to HTML and CSS, and I loved learning how websites work. Even though the course was limited, I found w3schools.com and began teaching myself more.
          <br>
          <br>
          Then, one day, my PC suddenly stopped working after a power outage. I tested everything and discovered my motherboard had failed. I had no money to replace it — I couldn’t even replace my old phone that was already six years old. So I kept applying for jobs and hoping for the best.
          <br>
          <br>
          In July 2023, I got my driver’s license and decided to try deliveries, but that didn’t work out. Then, out of nowhere, a laser cutting company called me late one Thursday night in October 2023 — around 8:30 p.m. They wanted me to come in for an interview the next morning. I went, and the boss offered me training and a full-time position. I accepted.
          <br>
          <br>
          That job lasted nearly a year — eleven months and two weeks — and I truly enjoyed it. But everything happens for a reason. One day, the laser machine I operated broke down due to a power supply issue, and that moment made me realize something: it was time to return to my passion for IT.
          <br>
          <br>
          That same day, I decided to start studying again. I researched CompTIA certifications and found that the best path was to begin with CompTIA A+, then move to Network+, and later Security+. I ordered my A+ books and started studying. A few weeks later, the machine was repaired, but it never worked perfectly again — 12 mm and 16 mm plates wouldn’t cut smoothly, no matter how well the settings were adjusted. Still, I kept working hard and got my Network+ books soon after because I knew A+ alone wouldn’t be enough.
          <br>
          <br>
          Around that time, one of my uncle’s friends (who was doing Cybersecurity work) told me about his job — protecting systems, managing IP threats, and more. It fascinated me, and he encouraged me to start earning my certifications to enter the IT field first before aiming for cybersecurity.
          <br>
          <br>
          By the end of my time at the laser company, I fully realized how important studying was for my future. After that, I took a bit of time to recover from some personal stress, and by November 2024, I made a clear promise to myself: January 2025 is when I restart.
          <br>
          <br>
          Laser cutting wasn’t easy. Some nights the machine worked perfectly; others, nothing went right. But I never quit, even on the toughest nights. I believe that challenges — like storms — come to test your strength, not stop you.
          <br>
          <br>
          When January 2025 arrived, I began studying again seriously.
          In March, I wrote my first IT exam — and failed.
          In May, I failed again.
          In June, I passed CompTIA A+ Core 1.
          In August, I failed Core 2.
          In September, I failed again — but that time I was sick during the exam. Still, no excuses — a fail is a fail. I’ve always believed in showing up, even when it’s hard.
          <br>
          <br>
          Finally, on the very last day of the 1100 series (in English), I told myself: Today, I pass.
          And I did.
          <br>
          <br>
          That moment meant everything to me — years of effort, frustration, and self-learning finally paid off.
          <br>
          <br>
          After earning my CompTIA A+ certification, I felt both happy and motivated to continue. I decided to return to Full Stack Web Development, not to switch careers completely, but to strengthen my technical background. I believe that the more you know, the better your opportunities become.
          <br>
          <br>
          I’m now studying for my CompTIA Network+ (N10-009) exam, aiming to complete it by January or February 2026, and I hope to earn CompTIA Security+ later that same year.
          <br>
          <br>
          Over the years, I’ve gained home experience fixing and troubleshooting computers — repairing BSOD errors, reinstalling Windows OS, diagnosing power supply or motherboard issues, and rebuilding PCs. When I was 12, I even set up home networks so all PCs could share drives and files securely.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2025, I also started working weekends at Orama, and in March that year, I helped with camera installations for a week (more details in my Experience section).
          <br>
          <br>
          One thing about me: I never give up.
          I send out CVs every day — 50 to 100 per day sometimes — because I believe the more effort you put in, the greater your chances become.
          <br>
          <br>
          🌏 Dreams & Goals
          <br>
          <br>
          I’ve always loved New Zealand — there’s just something about that country that captures my heart, especially Queenstown. It’s my dream to one day live and work there in IT, once I gain more experience and certifications.
          <br>
          <br>
          I also love the Western Cape, where I’ve spent time before COVID-19. I’d love to live and work there too, but so far, no luck finding opportunities. Still, I believe the right chance will come.
          <br>
          <br>
          On a personal note, I met a wonderful girl through gaming — she lives in Port Elizabeth. We share a lot in common, and we talk every day. She’s kind, beautiful, and someone I deeply care about. Whether it turns into a relationship or stays a close friendship, I want to be my best self for her, both personally and professionally.
          <br>
          <br>
          She dreams of living in the Western Cape too, and together, I believe we could build a good life there.
          <br>
          <br>
          Even though I’ve faced many setbacks, I’ve learned one thing: there’s always someone willing to give you a chance — it’s just about being ready when the opportunity arrives.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is who I am — my story, my journey, and my determination to keep learning, keep growing, and keep believing that hard work and passion will one day lead me exactly where I’m meant to be.

        <p class="IT-career">
        This is the question I’ve asked myself every single year.
        <br>
        Ever since COVID-19 hit in March 2020, my life changed completely — and not in a good way. For five long years, I’ve struggled to find my feet, rebuild my momentum, and get back to the life I wanted. 2020 to 2023 felt like one long “break year” — the kind of break where life just stops working, no matter how hard you try. 😞💔
        <br>
        <br>
        Things started improving in 2024 and 2025, but I’m still not where I want to be. I keep climbing but the hill just gets steeper. The harder I push, the harder it gets. It feels like every time I try to get out of the hole, something pulls me back down. But I haven’t stopped. I refuse to stop. 💪🔥
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2025, I told myself I would finish all my certifications — CompTIA A+, N+, and S+.
        <br>
        Reality hit me hard, and I was only able to complete my <b> CompTIA A+ </b> in September.
        <br>
        I’ve started studying <b> Network+ </b>, and that will be my 2026 exam… and I’m aiming for <b> Security+ </b> in the same year too. 📘💻🔐
        <br>
        <br>
        So what do I want from 2026?
        <br>
        <br>
        I want growth.
        <br>
        I want opportunity.
        <br>
        I want stability.
        <br>
        And I want a life that finally moves forward instead of backwards. 🌱🚀
        <br>
        <br>
        2026 MUST be my “make” year — the year that turns everything around, the year that takes me from <b> zero to hero </b>, the year I finally see the results of everything I’ve been fighting for. ⭐
        <br>
        <br>
        I want to leave Johannesburg.
        <br>
        I want to move to the Western Cape.
        <br>
        I want to live somewhere I feel alive again.
        <br>
        Somewhere I can prove myself, grow, and start fresh. 🌊🏙️
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m tired of break years.
        <br>
        I’m tired of struggling every day.
        <br>
        I’m tired of giving everything and getting nothing back.
        <br>
        I cannot live like that anymore. ❌
        <br>
        <br>
        But this time… I am standing up stronger than ever.
        <br>
        I believe there is hope. I believe there is a chance.
        <br>
        A friend once told me, “If I can, then so can you.”
        <br>
        And he’s right — if he can do it, so can I. And so will I. 💯🔥

      <button class="accordion-btn"><b>💻 Why I Chose IT as My Career</b></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p class="IT-career">
        Ever since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by computers and technology. Growing up, I spent countless hours learning how things worked — and more importantly, how to fix them. 🧠
        <br>
        <br>
        I used to repair broken computers at home, especially when the infamous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) appeared. I’d reinstall Windows using CDs — from XP to Windows 7 and even Windows 8 — and bring those systems back to life. When programs stopped working, I’d troubleshoot and make them run again.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also loved installing new software when needed and made daily backup copies, just in case a hard drive failed. I even experimented with things that didn’t work — like trying to copy a Windows ISO file straight onto a USB and hoping it would boot 😅 — that’s how I learned about BIOS boot settings and making a USB drive properly bootable.
        <br>
        <br>
        One time, my dad’s printer stopped working because of a driver issue. I reinstalled the drivers and fixed the problem instantly. Another time, the printer wasn’t being detected because the USB cable was unplugged — one quick check, and problem solved! 🖨️
        <br>
        <br>
        Even back when we had slow DSL internet (1–2 Mbps), I was the one reminding everyone to stay safe online and avoid suspicious websites.
        <br>
        <br>
        Looking back, I realize those early moments were the foundation of my IT journey. As a primary school student — years before high school — I was already troubleshooting real issues, learning through curiosity and persistence. Everything I knew back then, I taught myself. 🌟

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p class="IT-career">
        Let’s start this way — I’ve worked in an engineering workshop for 5 years and later at a laser cutting company for 1 year. During that time, I gave my best every single day, but deep down I always felt like I was struggling to keep up. I worked hard, but my pace never matched the rhythm of the industry.
        <br>
        <br>
        After a while, I realized something important — this wasn’t about not being capable, it was about not being fulfilled. I knew that someone with my years of experience should’ve naturally grown faster and more confident in that field, but my heart just wasn’t in it.
        <br>
        <br>
        It’s not that the work was bad — in fact, it’s incredibly skilled and honest work 💪. With the right company and the right mindset, you can build a solid and successful future in engineering. But for me, it just didn’t feel right anymore.
        <br>
        <br>
        I truly believe that when you find a career that fits who you are — where passion meets purpose — that’s where you’ll thrive. And for me, that career is in IT. 💻✨
        <br>
        <br>
        I’ve accepted that my strengths belong in a field where I can grow through learning, troubleshooting, creating, and helping others through technology. That’s where I feel most alive, and that’s where my journey continues.

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p class="IT-career">
        In March 2020, something happened that changed the world forever — COVID-19. It was a dark time for so many people. Lives were lost, jobs disappeared, and the future became uncertain for millions. I was one of them.
        <br>
        <br>
        When the pandemic hit, I truly believed I’d find another job soon, but that wasn’t the case. Every company I applied to either stopped hiring or closed completely. Even with my experience, I couldn’t get a single interview — not one.
        <br>
        <br>
        During that time, I also injured myself while lifting something heavy and developed a small groin rupture. It’s not too serious, but it’s something I’ll need to get fixed once I can afford proper medical aid.
        <br>
        <br>
        Still, I didn’t give up. I kept trying. I posted my own ads offering to do any kind of work — cleaning yards, cutting grass, washing cars, painting, small repairs — anything that could earn me a little income. But even then, no luck.
        <br>
        <br>
        I walked around Boksburg and Anderbolt for days, going from company to company handing out CVs, hoping someone would give me a chance — even if it was unpaid, just for experience. But every door stayed closed.
        <br>
        <br>
        Those three years were some of the toughest in my life. I learned what it truly means to start from zero and still keep going. So when I finally got the call for a laser operator job, I accepted immediately — because I knew opportunities like that don’t come often.
        <br>
        <br>
        Looking back, I don’t regret it. That time taught me persistence, humility, and appreciation for every opportunity that comes my way. 🌟

        During those three tough years, I didn’t just sit back — I kept trying to find any kind of work I could. I looked everywhere for peace jobs, hoping even one small job could help me earn a little income. Unfortunately, nothing worked out.
        <br>
        <br>
        There were times when I helped out as a security guard, doing 12-hour shifts to protect residential complexes and small business areas. It wasn’t permanent work, but I was thankful for every chance I got.
        <br>
        <br>
        Besides that, I started learning something completely new — web development. I began coding my first webpages using Notepad++ and used a program called XAMPP to run my pages like a real web server. I can still remember how proud I was when I saw my first website running in a browser.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sadly, my computer broke during that time and I couldn’t afford to repair it, so I lost my progress. That was a hard moment because I was finally finding something I truly loved doing. Even today, I don’t have my own PC — I’m currently using a borrowed laptop to continue learning and building my IT skills.
        <br>
        <br>
        But even with all that, I never stopped believing in myself. 💪 Every setback just made me more determined to keep going, keep learning, and build a future in IT — the career I’ve always wanted.

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p class="IT-career">
        I have a few friends — no names needed — who were never interested in IT before. They didn’t even know what it really was until they started working in the field. Some of them asked me simple questions like, “What are these network ports for?” or “How do I install Windows?” or “Why is my hard drive not being detected?”
        <br>
        <br>
        One of my friends started a networking/security job without even doing the basics that CompTIA A+ teaches — yet he grew fast and gained solid experience. He even asked for my CV once, but when I sent it to him updated and ready, I still wasn’t given a chance at that company. I had my driver’s license, my own transport, and a strong will to work — but still, no interview.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another friend started with zero IT experience. His first day in the field was his first step ever into IT. He learned everything from the ground up at his job and now has good experience, even without certifications yet. He plans to get certified soon — and I truly respect that.
        <br>
        <br>
        But the truth is, even with my CompTIA A+ certification, even with years of self-learning and experience troubleshooting, setting up networks, and building PCs, I still haven’t been given that one real chance in the IT field. I’m not sharing this to complain — I’m sharing it because it’s reality.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m serious about my career. I want to work. I’m ready to grow, learn, and prove what I can do. One of my friends told me something that stuck with me:
        <br>
        “If I can do it, so can you.”
        <br>
        And he’s right — anyone can succeed if they believe in themselves and put in the work.
        <br>
        <br>
        Today, I’ve even built and coded my own website — with some help from ChatGPT — and it looks better than I ever imagined. It’s still not perfect, but it’s mine. Every bit of progress I’ve made reminds me that good things take time, and that’s exactly why I’ll never stop trying. 🌟💻

      <button class="accordion-btn"><b>🌍 My Plans for 2026</b></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p class="IT-career">
        As 2025 comes to an end, I can proudly say I earned my CompTIA A+ certification on September 25th, after passing my Core 2 exam. I’ve spent countless hours searching and applying for IT jobs — even short-term contracts — to prove my skills, but so far, no opportunity has come my way.
        <br>
        <br>
        That won’t stop me. Giving up is not an option. Every single day, I keep searching for new opportunities because I believe that consistency and effort always pay off in time.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2026, my main goal is to get my first IT job and gain real hands-on experience in the field I love. I also plan to relocate to the Western Cape, a place I’ve visited several times and completely fell in love with. I know living there won’t be easy — it’s expensive and competitive — but I’m ready to face any challenge that comes my way.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also have someone very special in my life — a wonderful woman from PE who dreams of moving to the Western Cape too. Together, we want to build a life, support each other, and work toward our goals.
        <br>
        <br>
        My 2026 plans may seem simple, but they mean everything to me:
        <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Find an IT job (even a small start is a big step forward)</li>
            <br>
            <li>Relocate to the Western Cape</li>
            <br>
            <li>Work hard for my own money and future</li>
            <br>
            <li>Continue studying for my CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications</li>
            <br>
            <br>
          </ul>
        All I want is an opportunity. I don’t expect anything for free — I want to work for it, because as they say:
        <br>
        “No work, no pay.”
        <br>
        <br>
        That’s the mindset I live by. Hard work, effort, and dedication — that’s what 2026 will be all about.

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p class="IT-career">
        I built my own website because I felt like there was <b>unfinished business</b> — something inside me telling me to go back and push further. Why look in just one direction when there are many paths to explore?
        <br>
        <br>
        The truth is, if I keep trying but don’t do more, I’ll never reach where I truly want to be. I don’t want to be 55 years old earning a small salary when I know I deserve more. I think differently — I believe in <b>building my own future.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        That’s why I decided to <b>code my own website</b> from scratch. Yes, I had help and guidance, but I wanted to prove that I have the skills, the drive, and the mindset to grow. I might not have the most professional or polished website yet, but it’s mine, built with my own effort and time.
        <br>
        <br>
        Instead of using a simple website builder and taking the easy route, I chose to <b>learn, code, and build</b> everything myself. Not everyone does that. I wanted to show that I’m a genuine person who always goes one step further than expected — someone who puts his <b>heart and determination</b> into his future.
        <br>
        <br>
        My long-term dream is to work in <b>cybersecurity</b>. I know that field is challenging — even on the quietest days, it demands focus and hard work. But I’m ready for it. Everyone starts from the bottom, and this is my way of starting: by proving my passion through action.
        <br>
        <br>
        That’s why I built my website — not just to show my work, but to show <b>who I am.</b>

        <p class="IT-career">
        Out of thousands of career paths, I chose <b>Information Technology</b> because it’s a <b>global, flexible, and rewarding field</b> — one that keeps growing and changing with the world. IT isn’t limited to one country or one type of company; it offers opportunities <b>worldwide</b>, far beyond where you’re born.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m from South Africa, but I’ve always wanted a career that can take me anywhere — a field where I can work remotely or even relocate abroad one day. IT gives me that chance. It’s one of the few careers where <b>remote work is possible</b>, and where your skills can open doors in places like <b>Europe, America, or Oceania.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        I’ve worked in other industries before — engineering, manufacturing, and even short-term security work. They’re all good, honest jobs, and I respect the people who do them. But I realized that those careers aren’t for me. They don’t interest me or motivate me the same way IT does. I want a career where I can <b>think, solve problems, and grow</b>, not just repeat the same work every day.
        <br>
        <br>
        Other jobs like financial advising or hospitality can be great for some people, but they’re not my passion. I know where my heart is — and that’s in IT. The world of computers, networks, troubleshooting, and security excites me. I enjoy learning how things work and how to fix them when they don’t.
        <br>
        <br>
        I don’t just see IT as a job; I see it as a career and a <b>lifelong path</b>. It’s a field that challenges me to keep learning, improving, and adapting. And that’s what I want — a career that grows with me.

        <p class="IT-career">
        Through my journey, I’ve worked <b>5 years in the engineering industry (fitting & turning) ⚙️, 1 year as a laser cutting operator 🔥, a week in camera installations 🎥, and now a few months as a security guard at Orama 🛡️</b> — where I also sometimes help waiters deliver orders 🍽️, clean tables 🧹, and even take small orders for customers ☕.
        <br>
        <br>
        Each industry taught me something unique. Every field has its own rhythm and challenges. I might not have been the best, but I always gave my best 💪 — even if I worked slower, I made sure the job was done right. At the laser company, I pushed myself hard, especially during night shifts 🌙, handling important jobs and making sure everything went out on time.
        <br>
        <br>
        There were times I struggled — like when I wished I knew more about setting up layers 🧩 — but every challenge taught me something valuable. Now, as a security guard, things are different: less pressure, fewer jobs, but a strong sense of responsibility to keep the place safe 🚨.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m grateful to have a job 🙏, and I’m proud of every step that brought me here. One day, all these experiences — from engineering to security — will show how much I’ve grown and learned. 🌱
        <br>
        <br>
        Because that’s what life is about: the more you learn, the easier things become in the end. So never forget what you’ve learned — one day, that experience might be exactly what you need again. 💫

        I had every opportunity to study when I was younger (from 17 to 27), but like most people, I didn’t listen the first, second, or even the third time. I thought I was clever, and that mindset took me nowhere. As 2024 was coming to an end, I realized I had made a big mistake and wasted so much time on things that never built my future. Not because I was lazy — I will work day or night, Monday to Sunday — but because I didn’t do the things I should’ve done when I had the chance. I can only blame myself, but the good news is that it’s never too late to change. I’m not old, but I’m older, and now I know the true value of studying. 📘
        <br>
        <br>
        Some days I didn’t even have time to make my bed, but I still chose to open my book and learn. Why? Because I discovered that studying every day makes life easier, even when life is still hard. I don’t beg for work or opportunities — I ask, I try, and I work for them. I know I don’t know everything, but the knowledge I do have is something no one can ever take away from me. Today I am CompTIA A+ certified — and yes, that matters. It’s not the highest certification in the world, but it is the beginning of my journey. It proves that I can do real entry-level IT work and understand things I never knew existed. 🚀
        <br>
        <br>
        You don’t go to school and jump straight to matric at age 7 — you start at the bottom like everyone else. And this is my first step toward the next door. Doors don’t open by themselves, but when you work hard and prove yourself, the right door will open. What I’ve learned is simple: never stop dreaming, never stop learning, and never stop moving forward. And honestly… I actually enjoy learning now — gaining new skills and knowledge feels amazing. 🔥

        My love for the Western Cape started all the way back in 2007 when I visited during a school holiday. I was still in primary school, but those three weeks changed something in me — the scenery, the places we visited, the feeling of being there… it was unforgettable. In 2009 we went to Durban for Christmas, and honestly, that trip made me realize even more how much the Western Cape meant to me. The vibe didn’t click with me at all, not even on my 12th birthday.
        <br>
        <br>
        For the next five and a half years, I didn’t see the ocean again — until 2015, when I visited a friend in Gansbaai. The moment I arrived, the memories from 2007 came straight back. I loved it so much that I returned again that December for three weeks, and it felt like home. In 2017 I visited twice, including a long stay in Fish Hoek, and once again I felt that same connection. Then in 2019, I visited Hermanus, Simons Town, and Fish Hoek again for three and a half weeks — including my birthday — and it was honestly one of the best times of my life. Every time I go back, it feels right. It feels like me.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here in Johannesburg, I don’t feel that. I’m not unhappy, but I don’t feel like myself either. I don’t go out, I don’t do much, and it just feels like I’m here — nothing more. In Cape Town and the Western Cape, I feel alive. I enjoy life. I do things I love. Even something simple like swimming in the ocean makes me feel like I belong somewhere. Yes, life is harder and more expensive there, but the quality of life and the happiness I feel is worth it. 🌅
        <br>
        <br>
        Will I work in JHB if I need to? Of course — life takes us where we need to go. But deep down, the Western Cape is the place where I’ve felt the most like myself, and that’s something I’ll never forget. ❤️

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p class="IT-career">
          I’ve been thinking a lot lately, and I realised something important: even working on a cruise ship could be an amazing start for me. I’m open to opportunities, and I’m ready to work hard for real experience.
          <br>
          <br>
          I can contribute in two main ways on a cruise ship:
          <br>
          <br>
          1️⃣ IT Technician Roles:
          <br>
          <br>
          I have my CompTIA A+ certification, and I’m actively working toward my CompTIA N+ soon. Every day I’m building my IT knowledge, practicing, and preparing for real-world environments. Once I start doing networking projects, I’ll add those too.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you’re an employer reading this — yes, I am lifting my hand for a chance. I’m not begging; I’m simply showing my willingness to work, learn, and prove what I’m capable of. 💻🔧
          <br>
          <br>
          2️⃣ Hospitality & Support Roles:
          <br>
          <br>
          Right now, I work at a roadhouse, and I help whenever I’m asked — whether it’s serving, assisting the kitchen, or stepping in during busy times. I’m not afraid of hard work. I’ve worked 15–16 hour shifts when needed. I don’t complain, I don’t quit — I show up and I get the job done. 🍽️💪
          <br>
          <br>
          Prepared & Serious About This Path
          <br>
          <br>
          I understand that cruise ships require more than just certifications — safety training is essential, and I am already looking into how to complete that. 🚨
          <br>
          I also have a valid passport (until 2029), an unabridged certificate, and I will apply for a visa once needed. 🛂
          <br>
          <br>
          Why a Cruise Ship?
          <br>
          <br>
          • Because working on a ship gives me everything I want in life right now:
          <br>
          • A chance to prove my worth
          <br>
          • Meeting new people from all over the world 🌐
          <br>
          • Gaining international experience
          <br>
          • Growing my skills
          <br>
          • Seeing new places
          <br>
